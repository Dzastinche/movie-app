## Hello and welcome

Thanks for taking time and participating in this great repo, where we will try to collaborate and parctice our Javascript and React skills,
that I am sure will be of great value for all of us.
Now before we begin please take a time a go through list of prerequisites needed to run this project successfully.

## Clone the repo

We would consider that you have setup your cli enviroment to successfuly clone project. If not please follow [this link](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git).

 1. Please type in following command in your cli:
    
    ``` git clone git@github.com:Magnificent-12/movie-app.git```
2. Navigate to ***movie app folder/directory***

3. Please make sure that you have NodeJS installed and Node package manager (npm or yarn). **NPM is recommended**. If however you haven't got Node js on your system, please [follow](https://nodejs.org/en/) in order to install NodeJS. Please note that you should always go for the version with the label of **LTS(long term stable)**.
To check if you have NodeJS and packege manager installed, please run following commands in cli:

    **For NodeJS**

    ```node -v```

    **For package manager**
    
    ```npm -v``` or ```yarn -v```  depending on your package manager preferances. 

    After confiring all tools necessery are in place, please run following command to insatll needed dependancies:
    
    ```npm i``` or ``npm install`` or ``yarn install``
4. Next step is to run project which will require us to run one more command and we are good to go. Please run:

    ```npm start``` or ```yarn start``` to start project. It will take some time (up to few minutes), after your developing enviroment would runn successfully and of course
